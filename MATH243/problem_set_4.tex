\section*{Problem 1}
$B \models C$ just in case $\models (B \to C)$ \\
just in case $\bar{v}(B \to C) = T$ \\
just in case \\
$\bar{v}(B) = T$ and $\bar{v}(C) = T$ \\
or \\
$\bar{v}(B) = F$ and $\bar{v}(C) = T$ \\
or \\
$\bar{v}(B) = F$ and $\bar{v}(C) = F$ \\
In the second two cases, $\bar{v}(B) = F$ 
   which means $\bar{v}(\neg{B}) = T$\\ 
Hence $\models \neg{B}$\\
In the first two cases $\bar{v}(C) = T$ which means $\models C$\\
So in all three cases $\models \neg{b}$ or $\models C$.


\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
$(x \land y \land \neg{z}) \lor (x \land \neg{y} \land z) 
   \lor (\neg{x} \land y \land z) \lor (\neg{x} \land y \land \neg{z})
   \lor (\neg{x} \land \neg{y} \land \neg{z})$

\subsection*{(b)}
$\neg{(x \land y \land z)} \land \neg{(x \land \neg{y} \land \neg{z})}
      \land \neg{(\neg{x} \land \neg{y} \land z)}$\\
$\Rightarrow (\neg{x} \lor \neg{y} \lor \neg{z}) 
      \land (\neg{x} \lor \neg{y} \lor z) \land (x \lor y \lor \neg{z})$

\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{(a)}
Let $C = \{$customers$\}$ $J = \{$Jeans$\}$ $J_x = \{$Jeans that fit $x \in C\}$. We know that $\forall x_1,\ldots
   ,x_m$ $\exists j_1,\ldots,j_m$ such that $j_i \in J_{x_i}$ where $i = 1, \ldots, m$\\
\\
Assume $J_x$ is finite $\forall x \in C$\\
Need to show that there is a way of assigning jeans to customers so that every $x \in C$ buys a $j \in J$ that fits
and no two customers but the same pair of jeans.\\
(i.e. $\exists p: C \rightarrow J$ such that $p(x) \in J_x$ and $p$ is injective)\\
\\
Let $\Sigma \subseteq \bar{\mathscr{S}}$ such that $\exists v:\mathscr{S} \rightarrow \{T, F\}$ satisfying $\Sigma$
   iff There exists such a function $p$\\
\\
We will use sentence letters: $b_{xj}$ to build the wffs in $\Sigma$\\
\\
Let $\Sigma = A \cup B \cup C$ where\\
$A = \{ \bigvee_{j \in J_x} b_{xj}, \forall x \in C\}$\\
$B = \{b_{xj} \rightarrow \neg{b_{xl}}, \forall x \in C, \forall j,l \in J, j \neq l \}$\\
$C = \{ b_{xj} \rightarrow \neg{b_{yj}}, \forall x,y \in C, \forall j \in J \}$\\
\\
It is useful to note that by $A$ every customer $x \in C$ buys a pair of jeans (i.e. $p(x) \in J_{x}$), by $B$
every customer only buys one pair of jeans (i.e. $p$ is well defined) and by $C$ every pair of jeans is only 
bought by one customer (i.e. $p$ is injective).\\
\\
Now we can show that $\Sigma$ is satisfiable using the compactness theorem.\\
\\
Let $\Delta \subseteq \Sigma$ be finite.\\
\\
Lemma: $\Delta \subseteq \Delta'$ and $\Delta'$ is satisfiable then $\Delta$ is satisfiable.\\
\\
Let $C_0 = \{ x \in C | b_{xj}$ shows up in some wff in $\Delta \}$ and $J_0 = \{ j \in J | b_{xj}$ shows up
in some wff in $\Delta \}$, these sets are both finite because $\Delta$ is finite.\\
Now let $J_1 = J_0 \cup \bigcup_{x \in C_0} J_x$ and take $\Delta'$ to be the set:\\

$\Delta' = \{$all wffs in $\Sigma$ built from $b_{xj}$ with $x \in C_0$ and $j \in J_1\}$\\
\\
Now to show that $\Delta'$ is satisfiable, we have a finite set of customers $C_0$ and we can define\\

$p': C_0 \rightarrow J_1$\\
\\
We can show that $p'(x) \in J_{1_x}$ because the definition of $J_1$ says that it contains all of the sets of 
fitting jeans for each customer. We know that $p'$ is also well defined and injective. Therefore $\Delta'$ is
satisfiable. Meaning $\Delta$ is satisfiable and by the compactness theorem $\Sigma$ is satisfiable.
\subsection*{(b)}
We can show that the conclusion will not hold if we drop the extra hypothesis by providing a coutnerexample.\\
\\
Let $C = \{c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots \}$ and $J = \{j_0, j_1, j_2, \ldots \}$\\
There is at least one customer that fits infinitely many jeans because we dropped the extra hypothesis (i.e. say
$c_0$ fits $j_0, j_1, j_2, \ldots$)\\
Say\\
$c_1$ only fits $j_0$\\
$c_2$ only fits $j_1$\\
$\vdots$\\
This satisfies the conditions of the problem because given a finite set $D = \{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_m \} \subseteq
C$ we can say $c_i$ fits $j_{i-1}$ for $i = 1, \ldots, m$ then $c_0$ fits $j_m$.\\
Now if we set up a function $p: C \rightarrow J$ as:\\

$p(c_i) = j_{i-1}, \forall i > 0$\\
\\
Then there is no pair of jeans for $c_0$ to buy.
