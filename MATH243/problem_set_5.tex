\section*{Problem 1}
Assuming\\ 
$\nvDash \neg A \Rightarrow$ there exists some truth assignment, $v$ such 
  that $\bar{v}(\neg A)=F$, $\bar{v}(A)=T$\\
$\nvDash B \Rightarrow$ there exists some truth assignment, $w$ such 
  that $\bar{w}(B)=F$\\
No conjunct of $A$ is a disjunct of $B$\\

For truth assignment $v$, every conjunct of $A$ must evaluate to true. 
If one conjunct in $A$ were also a disjunct of $B$ then $\bar{v}(B)=T$. 
However, this contradicts our original assumption that no conjunct of $A$ 
is a disjunct of $B$. Therefore $A \nvDash B$.\\

For truth assignment $w$, every disjunct of $B$ must evaluate to false. If 
one disjunct of $B$ were a conjunct of $A$ then $\bar{w}(A)=F$. This, too 
contradicts our original assumption that no conjunct of $A$ is a disjunct 
of $B$. Therefore $A \nvDash B$
